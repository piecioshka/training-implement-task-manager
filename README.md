# training-implement-task-manager

♨️ Exercise through which you learn how to write code by passing unit tests.

## What's going on?

* I've written some __unit tests__ to describe sample production code in `test/`
* Your mission is to **complete the implementation** by writing a code in `src/`

## How to complete the training?

### 1. **Clone** :busts_in_silhouette:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:piecioshka/training-implement-task-manager.git
```

### 2. **Open** :hammer:

Open the `index.html` file in the browser and __refresh__ after wrote some code.

### 3. **Implement** :construction:

* Open the `src/task-manager.js` file in the editor
* Write that code which cover each of test cases
* The mission is complete when **all unit tests are passing** :tada:

:warning: **You must cover all unit tests** :warning:
