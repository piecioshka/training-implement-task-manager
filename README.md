> ♨️ Exercise through which you learn how to write code by passing unit tests.

## What's going on?

I've written some unit tests to describe sample production code.<br/>
Your mission is to **complete the implementation** by completing a code file.

## How to complete thr task?

1. **Clone**

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:piecioshka/training-implement-task-manager.git
    ```

2. **Open**

    Open the `index.html` file in the browser.

3. **Implement**

    Put your code in the `app/scripts/task-manager.js` file. **You must cover all unit tests.**

4. **Verify**

    The mission is complete when **all unit tests are passing** :tada:
